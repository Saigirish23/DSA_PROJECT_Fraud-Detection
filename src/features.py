features.py — Graph Feature Engineering (DSA Core)

Computes structural graph features for every node in the transaction graph.
Each feature is implemented with a clear explanation of:
  - What the algorithm does
  - Why it matters for fraud detection
  - Its time complexity

Features computed:
  1. Degree (in + out)     — O(V + E)  — Hub detection
  2. Clustering Coefficient — O(V · d²) — Broker/mule detection
  3. PageRank              — O(k·(V+E)) — Centrality in flow network
  4. Betweenness Centrality — O(V · E)  — Bridges between clusters

def compute_degree(G):
    """
    Compute in-degree, out-degree, and total degree for each node.

    Algorithm:
        For a directed graph, in-degree = number of incoming edges,
        out-degree = number of outgoing edges. Total degree = in + out.
        This is computed by a single traversal of the adjacency list.

    Why it matters:
        High-degree nodes are hubs in the transaction network.
        Fraudulent accounts often have unusually high degree because
        they transact with many victims or launder through many accounts.

    Complexity: O(V + E)
        Each edge contributes to one in-degree and one out-degree count.

    Args:
        G (nx.DiGraph): Directed transaction graph.

def compute_clustering(G):
    """
    Compute the clustering coefficient for each node.

    Algorithm:
        The clustering coefficient measures the fraction of a node's neighbors
        that are also connected to each other (triangle density). For a directed
        graph, we use the undirected version to compute triangles.

        For each node v with degree d(v):
            C(v) = 2 * |triangles(v)| / (d(v) * (d(v) - 1))

        Triangle counting is done by checking, for each pair of neighbors (u, w),
        whether an edge (u, w) exists.

    Why it matters:
        Legitimate accounts tend to form tight-knit communities (high clustering).
        Fraudulent accounts acting as brokers or mules connect disparate groups,
        resulting in LOW clustering coefficients. This makes clustering coefficient
        inversely correlated with fraud likelihood.

    Complexity: O(V · d²)
        For each node, we examine all pairs of neighbors. In the worst case
        (star graph), d can be O(V), making it O(V³). In sparse graphs with
        bounded degree, it's much faster.

    Args:
        G (nx.DiGraph): Directed transaction graph.

    Returns:
        dict: {node_id: float} — clustering coefficient in [0, 1].
    """
    logger.info("  Computing clustering coefficients... [O(V·d²)]")
    # low clustering often means a node connects otherwise unrelated accounts

    # Use undirected version for triangle counting
    undirected = G.to_undirected()
    clustering = nx.clustering(undirected)

    return clustering


def compute_pagerank(G):
    """
    Compute PageRank for each node using the power iteration method.

    Algorithm:
        PageRank models a random walk on the graph. A surfer at node u follows
        a random outgoing edge with probability (1 - alpha), or jumps to any
        random node with probability alpha (damping factor, typically 0.85).

        The score represents the steady-state probability of the surfer being
        at each node. Computed iteratively:
            PR(v) = alpha/N + (1-alpha) * Σ PR(u) / out_deg(u)
                    for all u with edge u→v

        Iteration continues until convergence (change < epsilon) or max
        iterations reached.

    Why it matters:
        PageRank measures a node's importance in the flow network. Fraudulent
        accounts that receive money from many sources (e.g., in money laundering)
        will have high PageRank because they accumulate "importance" from
        incoming transactions.

    Complexity: O(k · (V + E))
        Each iteration traverses all edges once. k = number of iterations
        until convergence (typically 50–100 for sparse graphs).

    Args:
        G (nx.DiGraph): Directed transaction graph.

    Returns:
        dict: {node_id: float} — PageRank score (sums to 1.0).
    """

def compute_betweenness(G):
    """
    Compute betweenness centrality for each node.

    Algorithm:
        Betweenness centrality measures how often a node lies on the shortest
        path between all pairs of other nodes. For each pair (s, t), we run
        BFS (unweighted) from s, then accumulate the fraction of shortest
        paths through each intermediate node.

        BC(v) = Σ σ(s,t|v) / σ(s,t)
                for all s ≠ v ≠ t

        where σ(s,t) = number of shortest paths from s to t
              σ(s,t|v) = number of those paths passing through v

        Brandes' algorithm computes this efficiently by combining forward BFS
        with backward accumulation.

    Why it matters:
        Nodes with high betweenness are bridges between clusters. In fraud
        networks, these are often money mules or intermediaries connecting
        fraud rings to legitimate accounts. Disrupting these nodes can
        break the fraud network.

    Complexity: O(V · E)
        Brandes' algorithm runs BFS from each node (O(V+E) per source),
        for V sources total. For sparse graphs, this is approximately O(V·E).

    Args:
        G (nx.DiGraph): Directed transaction graph.
